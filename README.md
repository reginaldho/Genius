## Team
Name					      Course Code
Bhawna Soi				 DECO7350
Lu Boom					   DECO7350
Ariel Gao					 DECO7350
Xiaoxin Wang		 DECO3500
Reginald Ho			 DECO3500
It is hard to decide who is the best suitable person to become the leader to lead the team due to everyone has their own personality and ability, we finally have decided Bhawna to undertake the position. Since she has the longest study life than rest of the teammates, we have decided to let her become the leader and manage the project. We believed it is the best decision and she will lead the team successfully. 
For the logistics part, Lu will undertake these jobs. She will be responsible for manage a team meeting, to group up which time is comfort for everyone for a team meeting and in charge of book a room for meeting. However, we thought it is not necessary to provide transport because most of the activities will be held in the campus and we will only use out own computer or faculty’s computer to complete our work.
To fill the key rolls, we decide to let Reginald to do the back end role, Bhawna will in charge of front end, XioaXin and Ariiel will in responsible for thinking content part and Lu will design the product interface.
When every huge decision need to be made, we will use vote to decide which decision we will choose and on one can argue the final result, we think this is the fairest method to make decision.
Whenever poor performance happens in the team, we will have a group meeting and review what is happening in our team, then we will decide how to improve and what should we do for a better team work. Nevertheless, to avoid these kinds of situation happen, we will encourage teammates to work and communicate with each other consistency, when teammate is in trouble for completing the work, we will give a hand to him/her and help her to pass through the plight. We believed that we will pass through every plight if we have good communication and attitude, we strictly prohibit to blame others no matter they did bad or not good enough to achieve the requirement. Bhawna will come out if there is conflict exist in our team, because she has the most experience in the society and she will know how to resolve the clash. 

## Communication
Where and when will your team meet and how will you all communicate? Where will files 1
be stored and shared? What are the file naming conventions?
Identify the social platform/s your team has adopted and explain the choice. How will it facilitate
communication and / or file sharing? 

### Meetings
* Meetings are held during the contact weekly and additional meeting is considered if it is necessary.The additional meeting should be proved by every teammember and the time will be decided based on the available schedule of the whole team,ensuring everyone can attend the meeting.
* Every team member should need to report what they had done in the last week,what they are doing right now and what they are going to do in the weekly meeting during the contact session,making sure that the team project is on track.
* A at least 24-hours meeting notice should be given which involves meeting location,time and meeting contents.Hence,team members can prepare to the meeting.Every team member is required to attend the meeting except for reasonable reasons and a 24-hour notice should be given through Facebook group to the team members.
* If a team member sledom reply any Facebook messages or contribute to the team,a warming would be given to him/her at first.If continued failure to comply,the team would disscus with tutor about current situation and probobaly take further actions on Peer Assessments.

### Tools
* Facebook message would be the primary instance communication channel for project notification and project management because every teammember has their Facebook account on their phone,ensuring all the newest updates of project can be known by every team member at the first time and nothing urgent is missed.In addition,every team member should give respond within 24 hour.
* Slack would be used as well,sice it's not mobile and less convinience comparing with Facebook message.Because all the DECO2800 tutors are on slack which it is useful for the team to seek help from tutors and to solve problems,the Slack is considered as secondary communication channels.
* Google drive and Github would be used as support tool for sharing resources online and since it will have record for each one's contribution and the team can identify the current project easily from the records and adjust the workload.Also,Google drive and Github allowing multiple people working on the same document at the same time which can improve the team efficiency dreamatically.
### Naming Convention
The default naming convention for all the files would be :TEAMNAME_XXX
